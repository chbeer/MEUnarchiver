# MEUnarchiver

Attempt at implementing a replacement for NSUnarchiver which is not available under iOS. This can be handy for reading legacy file-formats on iOS devices. It does not provide all features of NSUnarchiver but the basic stuff is there.

## Usage

```
let data = Data(â€¦)
let unarchived = MEUnarchiver.compatibilityUnarchiveObject(
  with: data, 
  decodeClassName: "NSColor", 
  asClassName: "MEColor"
)
```
